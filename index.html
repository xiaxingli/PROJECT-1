      <h3>
        In most cases, present problems are unfixable. We can't design our way
        out of the current mess with the tools that got us here. We could,
        however, work with future as a tool, a medium to aid imaginative
        thoughts. Future can be worked as a tool because afterall, future is a
        medium, not the destination.
